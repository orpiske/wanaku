* An MCP server engine that receives MCP requests and forwards them to the appropriate provider or service using gGRPC
* A set of service providers capable of reading resources from different systems 
* A set of service tools capable of interconnecting with any of the more than 300 components supported by [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org)
* Auxiliary tools and APIs to manage and/or extend the MCP router.
